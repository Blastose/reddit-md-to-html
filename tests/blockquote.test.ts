Might be a dumb question but I really don't understand the \`in_set\` function from this post.

Are we adding \`gravity\` to \`PhysicsSet\`? Why did we mention \`Movement\` then? Does this have to be added to a set inside a \`app.add_system()\` call? I feel like the other examples and docs don't help explain what is going on here...

...

Okay, I think I get it now, this isn't a set of systems, but instead a set of labels. I'm going to post my comment anyways because I personally found this very confusing, and I think the naming could use some work. Sounds amazingly powerful now that I understand it correctly.`;
